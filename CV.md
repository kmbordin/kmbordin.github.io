## Soft skills and knowledge

Over the past few years, I have been developing the following skills:

-   Analytical expertise in linear models (including generalised and mixed models) and multivariate analyses.

-   Proficiency in coding with the Tidyverse package (especially ggplot2 and dplyr).

-   Management of large datasets of biological data.
