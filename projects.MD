Welcome to a space dedicated to understanding the complexities of forest ecosystems. My research focuses on exploring patterns in forest structure, species ecological strategies, and carbon dynamics, providing insights to guide conservation and restoration efforts. In addition, my studies have a special emphasis on how theses ecosystems respond to global changes.

#### Some projects & partners:

Global collaborations:

[Alliance for the Tropical Forest Science](https://www.alliancetropicalforestscience.net/) (ATFS): The ATFS is a collaboration of 11 tropical forest research networks, and we have a particular interest in advancing science on tropical tree mortality, under the [Mortality Working Group](https://www.alliancetropicalforestscience.net/working-groups.html).

[ForestPlots.net](https://forestplots.net/): This is a huge and important network of more than 2800 researches working together to measure and monitor tropical forests globally - see [Taking the pulse using of Earth's tropical forests using networks of highly distributed plots](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108849), published in Biological Conservation.

[International Tree Mortality Network](https://www.tree-mortality.net/): a global community of researchers to quantify, predict, and understand the tree mortality patterns in global scale.

Brazilian collaborations:

**LERSAF**: Long-term Ecological Research in Subtropical Atlantic Forests: Coordinated by Dr. Sandra Cristina M√ºller.

**SoBio**: Solu√ß√µes da Biodiversidade para Mitiga√ß√£o das Mudan√ßas Clim√°ticas (Nature-based solutions for climatic change mitigation): Coordinated by Dr. M√°rcia Cristina Mendes Marques.

[**Rede DAMA**](https://rededama.github.io/) (Din√¢mica Ambiental da Mata Atl√¢ntica- Atlantic Forest Environmental Dynamics): a network of researchers united to understand the complex dynamics of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot of biodiversity.

Recently, I have been developing a GitHub repo to organise and store R codes to evaluate forest structure and dynamics. This repo is now public and you can use it! If you find any problems please reach out at kauanembordin[at]gmail.com
